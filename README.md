This is the readme file. It says in the tutorial to write something about myself. So, here it is.  I'm a programmer, I like chess, and if you already know me, then everything else is redundant.  And if you don't know me, why are you reading this?  Just because it says it's public doesn't mean I want you to know everything! What are you, some sort of spy, looking for clues?

Well, I will write the secret message in invisible ink.

Aha! you now know the secret message!  Be sure to use your decoder ring!
